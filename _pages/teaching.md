This is an archive of selected teaching, conferences, interviews, meetups etc I have been involved with. After 2015 my work changed and so did my involvement in these activities (and to be fair: most of this work was extracurricular, and becoming a parent for the first time in 2014 did not leave much extra space). I'm still fondly looking back at this work though, and am sure that some time in the future I will do more of it again.

_Review committee member_

The Norvig Web Data Science Award is an award for students and researchers studying at or employed by a research institute or university in the Netherlands. It is a challenge, sponsored by SURFsara, Common Crawl and Github, in which participants show what they can do with the Common Crawl dataset - a snapshot of a large part of the web - using SURFsara’s Hadoop service to provide big data compute power. The challenge is named after Peter Norvig, Research Director at Google and author of the seminal textbook [Artificial Intelligence: A modern Approach](http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~russell/aima.html).

**2014 Winner**: "_[ImTrends - The Trends of Images in World Wide Web](https://github.com/norvigaward/naward07/wiki)_" (by Feng Wang, Hong Huang & Vincent Gong, MSc students at Delft University of Technology)

_Founder & organiser_

<img align="left" src="/assets/img/nl-hug.png" />
I was the founder and main organizer of the Dutch Hadoop User Group (NL-HUG). This group grew to over 400 members over the course of 3 years and was the leading forum for Hadoop users from industry and academia in The Netherlands. We had speakers like [Russel Jurney](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=iRmPL-8AAAAJ&hl=en) (Hortonworks, author of Agile Data Science), [Lisa Green](https://commoncrawl.org/team/lisa-green) (CommonCrawl, director), [Jimmy Lin](https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/~jimmylin/) (Professor at University of Waterloo, Twitter, Cloudera), [Amr Awadallah](https://www.awadallah.com/) (Co-founder Cloudera), [Arun Murthy](https://g.co/kgs/aR8y5Lj) (Co-founder Hortonworks), and many others.

#### <i class="fa-solid fa-hashtag"></i> SIKS Big Data course for PhD students, 2011
_Organizer & lecturer_

A Hadoop / MapReduce course ([summary](https://repository.ubn.ru.nl/bitstream/handle/2066/227275/227275.pdf?sequence=1)) for the School for Information and Knowledge Systems (SIKS), with prof. [Djoerd Hiemstra](https://www.ru.nl/personen/hiemstra-d), prof. [Arjen de Vries](https://www.ru.nl/personen/vries-a-de) and prof. [Jimmy Lin](https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/~jimmylin/).

Abstract: _The School for Information and Knowledge Systems SIKS and the Dutch e-science grid BiG Grid organized a new twoday tutorial on Big Data at the University of Twente on 30 November and 1 December 2011, just preceding the DutchBelgian Database Day. The tutorial is on top of some exciting new developments in large-scale data processing and data centers, initiated by Google, and followed by many others such as Yahoo, Amazon, Microsoft, and Facebook. The course teaches how to process terabytes of data on large clusters, and discusses several core computer science topics adapted for big data, such as new file systems (Google File System and Hadoop FS), new programming paradigms (MapReduce), new programming languages and query languages (Sawzall, Pig Latin), and new ‘noSQL’ databases (BigTable, Cassandra and Dynamo)._
